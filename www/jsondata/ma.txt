Across the far north of England and Scotland, snow is more likely with temporary accumulations of 1-3 cm at low levels, and 5-10 cm more typical across upland areas and isolated 10-15 cm on high ground north of the Central Belt. Once rain becomes established, all lying snow will melt rapidly. \n\nIn addition to the snow and ice, strong winds are expected across all parts, with gales or severe gales mainly across high ground. This will lead to blizzard conditions in some areas for a time.  Freezing rain is most likely to impact the Pennines northwards, with a consequent risk of ice accretion on structures and power lines.
