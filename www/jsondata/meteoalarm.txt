The focus for further impacts are expected to be across southwest England and particularly south Wales where the warning has been extended until the early hours of Saturday morning. Whilst rain has largely eased across the warning area during early Friday afternoon, a spell of heavy and thundery rain is expected to redevelop on Friday evening. A further 10-20 mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely across the area, but there there is a chance a few places could see 50-70 mm of rain in 3-6 hours; these higher accumulations more likely across south Wales mid-late evening.\n\nWhilst thundery rain will clear westwards overnight, there is the potential for further spells of heavy rain across parts of southern UK over the weekend. \n\nWhat should I do? \n\nCheck if your property could be at risk of flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. \n \nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.  \n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.  \n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.

there remains some uncertainty with exact details, areas of heavy and at times thundery rain are expected to spread north, then west, across England and Wales from this evening and overnight.

There is a lower chance that a few spots within the warning area could see 80-100 mm of rain by the end of Sunday which may fall in a fairly small period of time. These higher totals are slightly more probable in the southern half of the warning area. Given this region has also seen a lot of rain since Thursday, impacts may be more likely than would normally be expected for the time of year here.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nCheck if your property could be at risk of flooding.
