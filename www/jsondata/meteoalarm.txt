The focus for further impacts are expected to be across southwest England and particularly south Wales where the warning has been extended until the early hours of Saturday morning. Whilst rain has largely eased across the warning area during early Friday afternoon, a spell of heavy and thundery rain is expected to redevelop on Friday evening. A further 10-20 mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely across the area, but there there is a chance a few places could see 50-70 mm of rain in 3-6 hours; these higher accumulations more likely across south Wales mid-late evening.\n\nWhilst thundery rain will clear westwards overnight, there is the potential for further spells of heavy rain across parts of southern UK over the weekend. \n\nWhat should I do? \n\nCheck if your property could be at risk of flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. \n \nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.  \n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.  \n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.
