# Versioning

The version nomenclature consists of 3 digits separated by a '.'

**First digit**  indicates a major version update with significant changes to core features, coding and major new features.
**Second digit** indicates a mid-version update to add additional features.
**Third digit**  indicates fixes and corrections made during the duration of the version.

For example 4.3.5 would represent version 4 with 3 additional features and 5 fixes applied.


# DivumWX Repository

This repository consists of 3 branches

**The 'main' branch** is the current stable version.
**The 'development' branch** which is in constant development and is the basis for the next major version update, however, is it **NOT**, by any means, production ready and is **NOT** to be used on a production site.
**The 'gh-pages' branch** which hosts the pre-installation input page.


# If you wish to collaborate

Make your own fork from the 'development' branch and use that for your own working platform. Any pull requests you make must be made back to the 'development' branch where it will be evaluated.
