# DivumWX skin for WeeWX - Now Under Construction
Weather Station website skin with Live Data for WeeWX. This version is compatible with WeeWX 4.6.x builds / Python 3.x. **This version of the template requires either the extended database schema introduced with WeeWX 4.0.0 or one that has been manually extended to included fields for lightning data.** It is strongly recommended that you start with an entirely new clean Python3 install of WeeWX 4.4.0 or later.


# Setup

Follow the instructions in the 'installation guide' ([INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/Millardiang/weewx-divumwx/blob/alpha/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)) to install the template.
