# DivumWX skin for WeeWX - Now Under Construction
Weather Station website skin with Live Data for WeeWX. This version is compatible with WeeWX 4.6.x builds / Python 3.x. **This version of the template requires either the extended database schema introduced with WeeWX 4.0.0 or one that has been manually extended to included fields for lightning data.** It is strongly recommended that you start with an entirely new clean Python3 install of WeeWX 4.4.0 or later.


# Setup

Follow the instructions in the 'installation guide' ([INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/Millardiang/weewx-divumwx/blob/alpha/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)) to install the template.

# Credits for this version

Apart from Brian Underdown without him, this template would never exist, I would aslo like to acknowledge the following people: -

Jerry Dietrich for his massive contribution in converting my wild ideas into reality, putting me straight on my mediocre coding skills and having the patience of a dozen saints. Aslo Stephen, Sean, Chris, Ray, Mauro, Frank for their invaluable contribution.

Gary Roderick for his original coding of Highcharts for WeeWX.

William Bailey aka Lightmaster who maitains the MB version of Weather34. Incredibly helpful and always on the end of Telegram when I need a chat, night or day.

Ken True for sharing files and who makes my job of maintaining the WeeWX version so much easier.

Thomas Sosio for his invaluable contribution in producing the Meteobridge lookup code to translate WeeWX database output.

David Marshall for contributing technical knowledge and solutions to create some original .tmpl files and alternative solutions for weather alerts.

Taylormia for contributing his excellent setup example for instances where WeeWX and server/template are remote to each other.

Gary Portellas for a helpful suggestion to further simplify the installation process.

Drealine for his recent work on extending the French translations.

All those unamed people who have helped me with testing updates.
